    "Graph theory is a fundamental area of computer science and mathematics that allows us to model and analyze relation between entities. A graph represents a system as a set of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. It can be uused to decribe structures where interactions or connections are important as the individual components themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, graphs are primarily used to model networks such as the Internet, communication systems, dependency graphs in software engineering, and data structures like trees and directede acyclic graphs. In social netwokr analysis, individuals are represented as nodes and friendships, relationships or interactions are modelled as edge to study influence, information flow etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "Molecules are composed of atoms arranged in specific spatial and bonding patterns that define their structure. The way atoms are connected determines the overall shape of a molecule, including features such as chains, rings and functional groups. These structural arrangements play a fundamental role in how molecules behave and interact with their environment."

Factors such as atomic composition, bond strength, bond type and connectivity affect properties like stability, reactivity, solubility and polarity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Molecular structures can be naturally represented using graphs, where atoms correspond to nodes and chemical bonds correspond to edges. This representation captures the connectivity of a molecule while abstracting away unecessary details, making it easier to analyze structrual patterns. Many concepts in chemistry, such as neighboring atoms, rings and branching , directly corresponds to graph theory concepts like adjacency, cycles and subgraphs."

Unlike traditional models that operate on vectors or grids of fixed size, GNNs learn by exchanging information between connected nodes. This helps  to capture both local interactions and global structural pattersn present in the graph."

    "When applied to graph representation of molecules, GNNs can learn how atomic levbel interactions contribute to overall molecular behavior. By aggregating information from connected atoms and bonds, these models are able to form meaningful representations of molecular structures. This makes GNNs well-suited for predicting various molecular properties, as they can model the relationship between structure and function.\n"
